This project, completed as part of the Modeling in Business Analytics academic coursework (August 2023 - December 2023), focuses on identifying key customer characteristics that influence purchase behavior and predicting the number of purchases made by individuals.

Leveraging advanced statistical methods, this project explores the following models to analyze customer purchase data:

Poisson Regression Model: For understanding the relationship between customer characteristics and purchase counts.
Negative Binomial Distribution (NBD) Model: To account for overdispersion in purchase behavior data.
Zero-Inflated NBD Model: To handle excess zeros in the dataset, representing customers with no purchases.
Finite Mixture Models (2, 3, and 4 segments): For segmenting customers into distinct groups based on their purchase patterns.
This comprehensive modeling approach allows for robust insights into customer traits and their impact on purchase behavior. The project's findings can inform targeted marketing strategies and enhance customer segmentation efforts.

Project Highlights

A deep dive into advanced statistical methods for customer behavior analysis.
